# TWS: Quiz App

I am currently using this app to improve my SwiftUI and [TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) skills.  

This app is created for my friend Reese Lansangan, an indie musician that I have met during the pandemic. She had this concept for her latest album that groups songs into their own curiosities and she created a personality quiz to find out what curiosity fans belong to. Check out [her music](https://open.spotify.com/album/39vgyUQqSdYeEF6J7WeSXE?si=k1RbL5DOQsGdk65bQMR-DQ)! 

## Roadmap

- Include animations for the transitions
- Include analytics data to keep a tally of the overall result
- Decouple the data and transform the app into a package that users can use to easily spin up quizzes and survey into their app
